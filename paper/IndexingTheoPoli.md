# Indexing the Theologico-Political 

In this paper we investigate how political theology has been indexed and
cataloged through the past 100 years.

## What is Political Theology? 


“Theology is broadly understood as discourse about God, and human persons as
they relate to God. The political is broadly understood as the use of
structural power to organize a society or community of people… Political
theology is, then, the analysis and criticism of political arrangements
(including cultural-psychological, social and economic aspects) from the
perspective of differing interpretations of God’s ways with the world."[@scott_blackwell_2013,1]


“ever-changing relationships between political community and religious order,
in short, between authority and salvation."[@vries_political_2009,25 This quote
is modified, but originally found in Jan Assmann _Herrshaft und Heil_ (Carl
Hanser Verlag: Múnchen 2000), 15]
