# Indexing the Theologico-Political 

Political theology is an important and growing field of theological research, 
which has also attracted the attention of political scientists, philosophers, 
and social theorists. This interest has led to different and often ambiguous 
definitions of what political theology actually is. In addition, related 
subfields like liberation theology, public theology, and critical theory are 
often associated with political theology, making categorization challenging. 
It is important that theological librarians understand the changing terrain 
of theological-political inquiry in order to better provide access for their 
research communities. 

In this presentation we will share some preliminary explorations we've done in
mining cataloged resources for subject headings related to political theology, 
as well as fulltext of titles in Hathitrust for 

## What is Political Theology? 

Part of what makes political theology an interesting test case is how 
variable it can be as a field of study. Political theology often describes 
a number of quite various subfields and methodological approaches. We will 
begin with a short discussion of some of the primary uses of the term. 

Political theology tends to include some sense of interesectionality or 
intedisciplinarity, which we see signaled in its name as dealing with 
“theology” and “politics” Cavanaugh and Scott offer this definition in the 
introduction to the Blackwell Handbook to Political Theology: 

> Quote Theology is broadly understood as discourse about God, and human persons 
as they relate to God. The political is broadly understood as the use of 
structural power to organize a society or community of people… Political theology 
is, then, the analysis and criticism of political arrangements (including 
cultural-psychological, social and economic aspects) from the perspective of 
differing interpretations of God’s ways with the world.^[William T. Cavanaugh and Peter Scott, “Introduction” in *The Blackwell Companion to Political Theology* (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2004), p. 1.]  

Another commonly quoted definition, from Jan Assmann, also highlights the dual 
aspect of the field by understanding political theology as examing the "ever-
changing relationships between political community and religious order, in short, 
between authority and salvation.”^[Jan Assmann, *Herrschaft und Heil* (Carl Hanser Verlag, München 2000) 15. Quoted from Hent de Vries, *Political Theologies*, 25. translation slightly modified.]​ 

On the other hand, political theology is often rooted in political practice 
itself by means of association with a particular political stance, context, 
or end. The primary example of this is liberation theology, which might also 
be associated with contextual theologies such as black theology, Mujerista 
theology, Dalit theology, Minjung theology, etc.

Another older example of contextually situated political theology is Christian 
Socialism. This designation was more common at the end of the 19th and beginning 
of the 20th century and often corresponds with what we refer to today as political 
theology. Notably, the journal *Political Theology* began life with the subtitle 
“a journal of Christian socialism,” although it doesn’t include this anymore. ​

Political theology is also defined in terms of a particular object of study, usually 
one that offers a theological ground for political life: sovereignty, authority, 
glory, legitimacy, etc.​

Political theology is also very often engaged with liberalism and secularism because 
both of these present a situation where the theological content of political life is 
not explicit. Political theology is often opposed to liberalism and secularism, or 
presented as a genealogical critique of them.​

## Why Should We Think About Political Theology?

First, it is an emerging field. While political theology has been around for a while, 
over the past few decades it has experienced a significant surge in publications, new 
journals, etc. It is important from the standpoint of collection development 
librarianship to be aware of important new trends in theological fields, and topic 
modelling and subject heading analysis can assist in better understanding new 
developments.​

As an interdisciplinary field, political theology often eludes clear-cut categorization. 
A good deal of literature that is recognizable as political theology does not bear a 
heading that says as much on the title page. ​

Important literature in political theology often pre-dates description of them as such. 
How do we interact with the metadata for these items?

## Controlled Vocabularies

In order to better understand the description of political theology literature, we will 
examine three important controlled vocabularies: the Library of Congress Subject Heading 
Authorities, the ATLA Religion Database (RDB) subject headings, and subject headings in 
HathiTrust Collection.

### LCSH Authorities 

The LCSH Authorities provide a helpful diachronic look at description practices for 
political theology because they include the year that each subject heading was 
established. Below are fifteen important subject headings for political theology texts.
While "Political Theology" itself is only added in 1998, important alternative 
subject headings appear in the 1980s, especially "Liberation Theology" and "Religion
and Politics." Throuhgout the 1990s, an increase in description of contextual
theologies related to political theology is notable, and in the 2000s this trend 
continues along with variations (i.e., "in literature", or "and race"). "Public
Theology" is also recognized as an important subject that is in many ways synonymous 
with political theology.

### Key Topics And Their Contents 



## Conclusion

Especially in the case of a complicated ifficulties are present on both ends of the library ecosystem​

Reference interviews will not always be clear-cut​

The existing collection, perhaps even archival material, includes literature relevant to political theology that often isn't described as such​

The taxonomical problem of understanding political theology begins with the task of controlled vocabulary and continues into the cataloging process​

Interdisciplinary, broad, ambiguous, and changing, but still differentiable​

There is more work to be done...​
