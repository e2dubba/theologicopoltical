# Indexing the Theologico-Political 

Political theology is an important and growing field of theological research, 
which has also attracted the attention of political scientists, philosophers, 
and social theorists. This interest has led to different and often ambiguous 
definitions of what political theology actually is. In addition, related 
subfields like liberation theology, public theology, and critical theory are 
often associated with political theology, making categorization challenging. 
It is important that theological librarians understand the changing terrain 
of theological-political inquiry in order to better provide access for their 
research communities. 

In this presentation we will share some preliminary explorations we've done in
mining cataloged resources for subject headings related to political theology, 
as well as fulltext of titles in Hathitrust for 

## What is Political Theology? 

Part of what makes political theology an interesting test case is how 
variable it can be as a field of study. Political theology often describes 
a number of quite various subfields and methodological approaches. We will 
begin with a short discussion of some of the primary uses of the term. 

Intersectionality or Interdisciplinarity 

Political theology tends to include some sense of interesectionality or 
intedisciplinarity, which we see signaled in its name as dealing with “theology” 
and “politics” Cavanaugh and Scott offer this definition in the introduction 
to the Blackwell Handbook to Political Theology: 

Theology is broadly understood as discourse about God, and human persons as they 
relate to God. The political is broadly understood as the use of structural power 
to organize a society or community of people… Political theology is, then, the 
analysis and criticism of political arrangements (including cultural-psychological, 
social and economic aspects) from the perspective of differing interpretations of 
God’s ways with the world.^[William T. Cavanaugh and Peter Scott, “Introduction” in *The Blackwell Companion to Political Theology* (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2004), p. 1.]  

Another commonly quoted definition, from Jan Assmann, also highlights the dual 
aspect of the field: 

“ever-changing relationships between political community and religious order, in 
short, between authority and salvation.”^[Jan Assmann, *Herrschaft und Heil* (Carl Hanser Verlag, München 2000) 15. Quoted from Hent de Vries, *Political Theologies*, 25. translation slightly modified.]​
